    <h3>Course</h3>
    <p>This is a Ruby on Rails event. The focus will be on developing functional web apps and programming in Ruby. You can find all the curriculum materials at docs.railsbridge.org.</p>
    <h3>Workshop Description</h3>
    <p>This workshop is intended to reach out to underrepresented groups in tech who are interested in learning Ruby on Rails.
      In this workshop, we'll take you through building a complete web application using Ruby on Rails. By the end of the day, you'll have an application that connects to a database and reads and writes information. We'll meet on Friday to install all of the software you need, and then spend Saturday learning and writing code. All skill levels are welcome.

      Check out the RailsBridge Triangle site for more information.</p>
    <h3>Sponsors</h3>
    <p>Industrious is providing the venue. Other sponsors are TBD.</p>
    <h3>Transportation and Parking</h3>
    <p>There is nearby public parking available. Check out Industrious for more info</p>
    <h3>Food and Drink</h3>
    <p>Pending sponsorship, we plan to provide pizza and drinks for the Installfest, and then breakfast and lunch during the Workshop.</p>
    <h3>Childcare</h3>
    <p>Childcare is available for free. Please specify when signing up if you need it. We'll need some advance notice to make arrangements, so if you're signing up close to the event, please email us at: railsbridgetriangle @ gmail.</p>
